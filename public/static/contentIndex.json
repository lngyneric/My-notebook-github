{"CODE_OF_CONDUCT":{"slug":"CODE_OF_CONDUCT","filePath":"CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md","title":"CODE_OF_CONDUCT","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Citizen Code of Conduct\n1. Purpose\nA primary goal of the Quartz community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\nWe invite all those who participate in the Quartz community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n3. Expected Behavior\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\nParticipate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\nExercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\nAttempt collaboration before conflict.\nRefrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\nBe mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\nRemember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n4. Unacceptable Behavior\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\nViolence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\nSexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\nPosting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\nPosting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).\nPersonal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\nInappropriate photography or recording.\nInappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.\nUnwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\nDeliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\nSustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n5. Weapons Policy\nNo weapons will be allowed at Quartz community events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.\n6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n7. Reporting Guidelines\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. j.zhao2k19@gmail.com.\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n8. Addressing Grievances\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify @jackyzha0 with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n9. Scope\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n10.
